# Patient Management Service

A full-stack microservices-based healthcare system built with Spring Boot. This monorepo contains independently deployable services for managing patient records, authentication, billing, analytics, and more.

This project leverages **gRPC** for fast inter-service communication and **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous event-driven architecture.
